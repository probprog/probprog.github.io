title: compiled Anglican released.
excerpt: 
---

A complete redesign and reimplementation of Anglican has arrived.

The new version of Anglican is an embedded language hosted in Clojure and supports just-in-time compilation of probabilistic programs to native JVM bytecode via a CPS transformation of Anglican into Clojure which then is JITed normally.

Anglican uses a new composable query syntax that blends ideas from [Church](https://probmods.org/play-space.html) and [Venture](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/) while retaining a look and feel quite similar to Clojure.
