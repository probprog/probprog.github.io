A group of Anglican contributors
([Jan Willem van de Meent](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/),
[Brooks Paige](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~brooks/), and
[Frank Wood](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood)) taught Anglican at the DARPA [PPAML](http://ppaml.galois.com/wiki/wiki/SummerSchools/2016/LectureMaterials)
summer school and the developed materials are linked below.  These are the
best way to get started quickly with Anglican.

- Programming Exercises

They also developed a large number of hands-on programming exercises to get you started quickly
with probabilistic programming and Anglican.  These are linked from the getting
started guide which also explains how to quickly install Anglican [link](https://bitbucket.org/probprog/ppaml-summer-school-2016/raw/master/docs/getting-started-guide.pdf).
