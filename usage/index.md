Anglican is tightly integrated with Clojure.  In order to learn to
program in the [Anglican language](../language/) you should probably invest
some time to learn [Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/introduction.html) and you must
install 
[leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) if you have not already.
Optionally you may wish to familiarize yourself with [Gorilla
REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org).

# Installing and Getting Started Guide

Full installation instructions and a getting started guide are available [here](https://bitbucket.org/probprog/mlss2015/raw/aa10c392733811aacf441f7b0fce8d6640db0372/docs/getting-started/anglican-getting-started-guide.pdf). 

Installing everything takes about 10 minutes.  Learning Anglican a few minutes if you know Clojure.  A few hours if you know functional programming -- a bit longer if you are entirely unfamiliar with functional programming.

# Using Anglican

An Anglican query can be either run as a standalone program, producing
the inference results on the standard output, run via a web-based read eval print loop (REPL)
notebook server (called Gorilla REPL), or invoked programmatically
from Clojure code. 

The
[anglican-user](https://bitbucket.org/probprog/anglican-user)
repository provides the environment and program templates for these
styles of usage.



## Calling Anglican from Clojure

The [anglican-user](https://bitbucket.org/probprog/anglican-user) repository 
contains a [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) `project.clj` with the suggested 
dependencies and namespace declarations.  Anglican is also available on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/anglican).

An Anglican query can also be invoked programmatically from
Clojure code, using the `doquery` macro, with the following
syntax:

    (doquery algorithm query value & options)

where `algorithm` is the keyword specifying the algorithm (`:lmh`,
`:pgibbs`, `:pcascade` etc.), `value` is the initial value passed to
the query (`nil` if the query does not expect arguments), and
`options` are Clojure clojure keyword arguments, specific to each
inference algorithm.  `doquery` returns a lazy sequence of samples â€”
objects encapsulating a map of predicts and the log probability of
each sample.

The example worksheets provide many examples of how do use `doquery.`  The language
tab explains how to construct the Anglican programs which are the essence of `query`'s.

## Browser-based REPL

[Gorilla REPL](http://www.gorilla-repl.org/) provides a convenient
environment for processing and visualization of inference results.
`worksheets/template.clj` is supplied as a starting point for an
Anglican worksheet.  Running

	lein gorilla
	
in the root of [anglican-user](https://bitbucket.org/probprog/anglican-user) starts a 
local http server which can be connected to via a local browser.  

## Running Standalone Programs

Standalone Anglican programs can be run from the command line
or in the REPL. The template for a standalone program, which you can
just copy and modify for your needs, is `programs/template.clj`.
The command line syntax is

    lein run namespace [program] [option ...]

from the command line, or:

    (m! namespace [program] [option ...])

in the REPL, where `namespace` is the namespace containing the
Anglican program to run, for example:

    bash$ lein run branching -a pgibbs -n 100 \
               -o ":number-of-particles 50"

    anglican.core=> (m! branching -a pgibbs -n 100
                      -o ":number-of-particles 50")
               
`program` is the first argument of `defquery`. The namespace
may contain multiple programs. If `program` is omitted, it defaults
to the last component of the namespace (hmm for anglican.hmm,
logi for anglican.logi).

### Options:

    -a, --inference-algorithm NAME   :lmh       Inference algorithm
    -b, --burn N                     0          Skip first N samples
    -d, --debug                                 Print debugging information
    -f, --output-format FORMAT       :anglican  Output format
    -n, --number-of-samples N                   Output predicts for N samples
    -o, --algorithm-options OPTIONS  []         Algorithm options
    -t, --thin N                     1          Retain each Nth sample
    -v, --value V                               Initial value to pass to the program
    -w, --warmup FLAG                true       Pre-evaluate the program
    -h, --help                                  Print usage summary and exit

### Redirecting Input and Output

Inference output is normally redirected to a file for post-processing. On the
command line, `>` can be used:

    bash$ lein run branching -a pgibbs -n 100 \
               -o ":number-of-particles 50" > branching.pgibbs

In the REPL, a macro `redir` is provided. The syntax is:

    (redir [:in "input-file-name" :out "output-file-name"]
      actions ...)

Either `:in` or `:out` (or both) can be omitted.
if the output file name begins with `+`, `+` is removed
and the output is appended to the file. In the REPL, the above
command example can be run as

    anglican.core=> (redir [:out "branching.pgibbs"]
                      (m! branching -a pgibbs -n 100
                          -o ":number-of-particles 50"))

Functions `freqs` (frequency table for every integer-valued or
symbolic predict) and `meansd` (mean and standard deviation for
each predict) can be used in the REPL to quickly assess the
results:

     anglican.core=> (redir [:in "branching.pgibbs"] (freqs))
     r, 0, 0.0260000, -3.64966
     r, 1, 0.0930000, -2.37516
     r, 2, 0.0740000, -2.60369
     r, 4, 0.00100000, -6.90776
     r, 5, 0.340000, -1.07881
     r, 6, 0.244000, -1.41059
     r, 7, 0.133000, -2.01741
     r, 8, 0.0590000, -2.83022
     r, 9, 0.0170000, -4.07454
     r, 10, 0.00700000, -4.96185
     r, 11, 0.00500000, -5.29832
     r, 12, 0.00100000, -6.90776
