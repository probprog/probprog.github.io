Implementing Bayesian nonparametric models in Turing-complete probabilistic programming systems is generally straightforward.  Further, completing the following exercise will suggest and illustrate a deeper connection between Bayesian nonparametrics and probabilistic programming.

 A short, very readable paper that gets towards the heart of the interplay between Bayesian nonparametrics and probabilistic programming is [A stochastic programming perspective on nonparametric Bayes](http://danroy.org/papers/RoyManGooTen-ICMLNPB-2008.pdf).
