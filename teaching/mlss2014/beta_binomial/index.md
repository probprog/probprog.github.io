# Automatic Bayesian Inference as Programming

Programs written in a probabilistic programming language implicitly define a generative prior and a data likelihood.
Running the probabilistic program performs Bayesian posterior inference.

A simple example, meant as an introduction to the language, in particular the `assume`, `observe`, and `predict` directives, demonstrates this.

As a reminder, a language reference is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/language).
For more background on Bayesian inference, and on the particular model in the exercise above, [these slides](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/teaching/W4240/Lectures/introduction/bayesian_inference.pdf) may be helpful.
