title: Things Higher Order Probabilistic Programming Systems Can Do That Others Canâ€™t

Higher order probabilistic programming systems allow direct manipulation of program text itself.  The means that, among other things, program text can be programmatically generated by a program and then evaluated.

In a probabilistic programming context this means that we can do inference about the program text that gave rise to an observed output or output relationship.  In short, we can get computers to program themselves.

In this exercise you will experiment with a probabilistic program that generates program text for computing the value of arithmetic expressions.
